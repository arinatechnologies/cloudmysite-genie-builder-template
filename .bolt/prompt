You are working inside an Eleventy (11ty) project that must be fully editable in GrapesJS.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
src/pages/*.html
src/_layouts/base.njk
src/_partials/head.html
src/_partials/header.html
src/_partials/footer.html
css/ (ALL CSS here)
js/
images/
lib/ (only if needed)
Output: public/
Passthrough: /css, /js, /images, /assets

RULES:
- Pages only in src/pages/*.html (Nunjucks allowed)
- Partials only in src/_partials/
- Layout only src/_layouts/base.njk
- Do not delete any files unless user explicitly asks

ANTI-DARK DEFAULT:

- Never set body, html, main, or section backgrounds to black or dark colors.
- If a dark tone is required, it may only be used in small components (≤120px tall) such as:
  - buttons
  - icons
  - badges
  - thin separators

PAGE FRONT MATTER (mandatory):
layout: ../_layouts/base.njk
title: "Page Title"
permalink: "/page.html"
extra_css: ["/css/page.css"]
extra_js: []

CONTACT FORM (mandatory structure):
<form id="contactForm" class="custom-contact-form" data-form-handler data-api="" data-from="noreply@example.com" data-success="Thank you! We will get back to you soon." data-error="Oops! Something went wrong." data-report-label="template-form">

FAQ RULE:
.card → .card-header a → .card-body  
Use unique IDs faq-1, faq-2, faq-3 with aria-controls

CSS:
- Each page has its own /css/page.css
- No inline CSS, no scss/sass
- Header/footer styles only in header.css/footer.css

LAYOUT RULES:
base.njk must include:
- head, header, footer
- <main>{{ content | safe }}</main>
- Load /css/header.css, /css/footer.css, /js/base.js, /js/form-handler.js
- Load extra_css and extra_js without duplicates

IMAGES & VIDEO (GRAPESJS EDITABLE):
- All key visuals must be real <img> or <video> elements (no CSS background-image for key visuals)
- If an image or video is meant to behave like a background/hero background:
  - It must still be an actual <img> or <video> element
  - Styled to cover full section 
  - Must visually behave as a background but remain editable in GrapesJS
- Use real, free stock image URLs from Pexels or Unsplash for all images
- Move all images to /images and update paths
- Overlays must not block clicks (pointer-events: none)

VIDEO:
If user requests video, always use native <video> element only (no iframe or embeds)

ICONS & BOOTSTRAP:
Use Font Awesome 6 + Icomoon CDN only, Bootstrap 5 attributes only

CAROUSEL:
No Owl/jQuery; use scroll-snap carousel + buttons, JS in /js/main.js (no jQuery)

SECTION RULE (CONTEXT-AWARE):
Each page must have 4-5 sections that match both the business type and the page purpose (Home, About, Services, etc.).
Do not reuse generic sections blindly; sections must be context-relevant (e.g., Cake Shop Home = Hero, Featured Cakes, Services, Reviews, CTA).
No filler sections — every section must make sense for that page and business.

PAGES:
Core pages: Home, About, Services, Contact, Blog, Privacy, Terms
Depending on website/business type, add relevant pages:
- Restaurant/Food: Menu, Reservations, Order Online
- Medical: Doctors, Appointments, Insurance
- Business: Solutions, Careers
- Ecommerce: Shop, Categories, Cart
- Education: Programs, Admissions
Each page must follow section rules.

COLOR THEMING (ENFORCED LIGHT + VARIETY):

- Global default MUST be a LIGHT theme.
  - body background must be white (#ffffff) or a light surface color.
  - body text color must be dark gray (#111827 – #1f2937), never white.

- NEVER use pure black (#000000) or near-black colors as page or section backgrounds.
  - Dark colors may only be used for small accents (buttons, icons, badges, dividers).
  - No section, main container, or body background may be dark.

- For every site, choose exactly ONE palette based on the business type and apply it consistently.
  - Write the chosen palette as a comment at the top of each page CSS file:
    /* Palette: primary #____, secondary #____, accent #____, neutral #____, surface #____ */

- Use ONLY the following palettes (do not invent new ones):

  Food:
    primary #d9480f
    secondary #f59f00
    accent #2f9e44
    neutral #1f2937
    surface #fff7ed

  Health:
    primary #0ea5e9
    secondary #22c55e
    accent #0f766e
    neutral #0f172a
    surface #f0f9ff

  Business:
    primary #2563eb
    secondary #0f172a
    accent #f97316
    neutral #111827
    surface #f8fafc

  Creative:
    primary #a855f7
    secondary #ec4899
    accent #06b6d4
    neutral #111827
    surface #faf5ff

  Retail / Ecommerce:
    primary #db2777
    secondary #111827
    accent #f59e0b
    neutral #111827
    surface #fff1f2

  Education:
    primary #4338ca
    secondary #2563eb
    accent #f59e0b
    neutral #0f172a
    surface #eef2ff

- Section background rule (strict):
  - Adjacent sections MUST NOT share the same background color.
  - Alternate between white and the palette's surface color.
  - At least two sections per page must use the surface color.

- Buttons:
  - Primary CTA buttons must use the palette primary color.
  - Secondary buttons must be transparent with a primary-color border.

- Apply colors directly in each page’s CSS file.
- No CSS variables.

STYLE DIVERSITY (MANDATORY):

For each generated website, choose ONE style direction and apply it consistently
through spacing, border-radius, and component shape.

Choose exactly one:
- Style A: Minimal corporate (sharp corners, subtle shadows)
- Style B: Friendly rounded (rounded corners, soft shadows)
- Style C: Editorial (larger typography, generous whitespace)
- Style D: Bold cards (visible borders, colorful accents)

Write the chosen style at the top of /css/home.css as a comment:
  /* Style Direction: B - Friendly rounded */


HEADER/FOOTER:
-Header navigation and footer content must change based on website/business type
-Links, CTA buttons, menu items, and footer info must match:
  -The industry (e.g., restaurant vs clinic vs ecommerce)
  -The available pages (Menu, Appointments, Shop, Careers, etc.)

NEVER:
- Delete files
- Clean up unused files
- Revert to starter template
- Remove assets
