You are working inside an Eleventy (11ty) project that must be fully editable in GrapesJS.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
src/pages/*.html
src/_layouts/base.njk
src/_partials/head.html
src/_partials/header.html
src/_partials/footer.html
css/ (ALL CSS here)
js/
images/
lib/ (only if needed)
Output: public/
Passthrough: /css, /js, /images, /assets

RULES:
- Pages only in src/pages/*.html (Nunjucks allowed)
- Partials only in src/_partials/
- Layout only src/_layouts/base.njk
- Do not delete any files unless user explicitly asks

PAGE FRONT MATTER (mandatory):
layout: ../_layouts/base.njk
title: "Page Title"
permalink: "/page.html"
extra_css: ["/css/page.css"]
extra_js: []

CONTACT FORM (mandatory structure):
<form id="contactForm" class="custom-contact-form" data-form-handler data-api="" data-from="noreply@example.com" data-success="Thank you! We will get back to you soon." data-error="Oops! Something went wrong." data-report-label="template-form">

FAQ RULE:
.card → .card-header a → .card-body  
Use unique IDs faq-1, faq-2, faq-3 with aria-controls

CSS:
- Each page has its own /css/page.css
- No inline CSS, no scss/sass
- Header/footer styles only in header.css/footer.css

LAYOUT RULES:
base.njk must include:
- head, header, footer
- <main>{{ content | safe }}</main>
- Load /css/header.css, /css/footer.css, /js/base.js, /js/form-handler.js
- Load extra_css and extra_js without duplicates

IMAGES & VIDEO (GRAPESJS EDITABLE):
- All key visuals must be real <img> or <video> elements (no CSS background-image for key visuals)
- If an image or video is meant to behave like a background/hero background:
  - It must still be an actual <img> or <video> element
  - Styled to cover full section 
  - Must visually behave as a background but remain editable in GrapesJS
- Use real, free stock image URLs from Pexels or Unsplash for all images
- Move all images to /images and update paths
- Overlays must not block clicks (pointer-events: none)

VIDEO:
If user requests video, always use native <video> element only (no iframe or embeds)

ICONS & BOOTSTRAP:
Use Font Awesome 6 + Icomoon CDN only, Bootstrap 5 attributes only

CAROUSEL:
No Owl/jQuery; use scroll-snap carousel + buttons, JS in /js/main.js (no jQuery)

SECTION RULE (CONTEXT-AWARE):
Each page must have 4-5 sections that match both the business type and the page purpose (Home, About, Services, etc.).
Do not reuse generic sections blindly; sections must be context-relevant (e.g., Cake Shop Home = Hero, Featured Cakes, Services, Reviews, CTA).
No filler sections — every section must make sense for that page and business.

PAGES:
Core pages: Home, About, Services, Contact, Blog, Privacy, Terms
Depending on website/business type, add relevant pages:
- Restaurant/Food: Menu, Reservations, Order Online
- Medical: Doctors, Appointments, Insurance
- Business: Solutions, Careers
- Ecommerce: Shop, Categories, Cart
- Education: Programs, Admissions
Each page must follow section rules.

COLOR THEMING:
Apply palette based on business type:
- Food, Health, Business, Creative, Retail, Education
- Apply colors directly in each page’s CSS file
- No CSS variables
- No background images for key visuals
- Adjacent sections must not share same background color
- Header/footer colors controlled only by header.css/footer.css
- Ensure readable contrast

HEADER/FOOTER:
Adapt nav and footer links based on business type.

NEVER:
- Delete files
- Clean up unused files
- Revert to starter template
- Remove assets
